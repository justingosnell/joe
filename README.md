# RoadsideMapper

Local development instructions

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run in development (this starts the server and Vite middleware):

```bash
# default port is 5000, or set PORT to override
PORT=5173 npm run dev
```

3. Open the app in your browser:

http://localhost:5173

If the app reports EADDRINUSE for port 5000, either pick a different PORT or stop the process using that port.
